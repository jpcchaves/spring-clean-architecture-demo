# Clean Architecture Blueprint

A brief implementation of Clean Architecture in a Spring Boot project using Java modules.

## Introduction

This repository aims to implement clean architecture principles in a Spring Boot project using Java modules. Clean architecture helps in constructing a well-organized and adaptable application by structuring the code into layers, thereby ensuring separation of concerns and enhancing flexibility.

## Clean Architecture

### Overview

Clean architecture is a software design approach that emphasizes the separation of concerns and independence from external frameworks and libraries. It partitions an application into distinct layers, each with its own responsibilities and dependencies, facilitating easier maintenance, testing, and flexibility.

### Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Organize the application into layers (e.g., core, application, infrastructure) with clear responsibilities, ensuring that each layer serves a single, well-defined purpose.

2. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies should always point inward towards higher-level policies or abstractions. Inner layers must not depend on outer layers, fostering loose coupling and flexibility.

3. **Isolation of Frameworks and Libraries**: Keep external frameworks, libraries, and implementation details isolated from the core business logic of the application, enabling smoother adaptation to changes in the environment.

### Benefits

- Modular and maintainable codebase.
- Improved testability and flexibility.
- Ability to adapt to changes in technology and requirements.
